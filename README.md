A wildlife tracker API utilizing Ruby on Rails alongside PostgreSQL, no frontend aspect but database can be accessed using postman.
Uses 2 databases, the animal database and the sightings database.

I learned how to make a rails API with full CRUD functionality!

What you can do:
1. Create a listing of an animal with the attributes common name (i.e. Tiger), latin name (Panthera Tigris), and kingdom (Animalia).
2. View (Read) your listings using SQL queries in Postman.
3. Update an animal listing.
4. Delete an animal listing.
5. Add sightings attributed to an animal using a foreign key.
